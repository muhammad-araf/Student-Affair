# Student Affair

Live Website: https://shuaffair.vercel.app/

Student Affair is a full-stack web application designed for Salim Habib University to manage Student Lost & Found, Queries, Appointments, Complains and student administrative services  
The system provides a centralized platform where students and administration can interact in a transparent, structured, and secure way.

This project is built as a real-world university system, not a demo project.

## Project Description

Universities often handle lost items, student complaints, queries, and appointments manually.  
This causes delays, missing records, and no historical tracking.

Student Affair solves this problem by providing a digital Student Affairs Portal where:

- Students report lost or found items using their official Student ID
- Admin can analyze student activity and monthly data
- Queries, complaints, and appointments are handled in one system
- All records are stored securely and permanently

Each student is identified using their university-issued ID (example: F24CSC039).
